# Learning Project: Number Detector ðŸ”¢
This repository is for the educational script that I developed for a number detector. It uses the MNIST dataset and trains a CNN using `nothing but math` <br><br>
The model was made to teach the gradient math of every part of the neural network, so the students understood the application and implementation of the theory they had just learned. Everything can be contanied into one notebook. There is no app, but rather they can see how their model performed via `matplotlib`
<br>
##### This was an educational model for students learning about CV. This was to demonstrate the pipeline with keras, as the repository below does everything with pure maths and demonstrates everything contained in a CNN as class structure
### Prerequisites
This model shows how the CNN works from scratch. Students should have gone through a theory lecture about ANN, backprop, frontprop, softmax, and activation functions
