# Learning Project: CNN Number Detector from `SCRATCH` ðŸ”¢
This repository is for the educational script that I developed for a number detector. It uses the MNIST dataset and trains a CNN using `nothing but math` <br><br>
The model was made to teach the gradient math of every part of the neural network, so the students understood the application and implementation of the theory they had just learned. Everything can be contanied into one notebook. There is no app, but rather they can see how their model performed via `matplotlib`
<br>
### Prerequisites
This model shows how the CNN works from scratch. Students should have gone through a theory lecture about ANN, backprop, frontprop, softmax, and activation functions
